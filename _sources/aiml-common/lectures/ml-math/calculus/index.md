# Calculus 

For this course you need to review some basic calculus. The best resource for it is [Khan Academy's Multivariate Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus). Go through the videos and exercises in Units 1 and 2 only. 

For more advanced reader, and specifically for fully understanding deep learning that includes _matrix calculus_  there is a very good reference [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01528.pdf).

We have also shot a recitation video for you to review some of the concepts.
