# Policy Evaluation (Prediction)

The policy $\pi$ is evaluated when we have produced the state-value function $v_\pi(s)$ for all states. In other words when we know the expected discounted returns that each state can offer us. To do so we apply the Bellman expectation backup equations repeatedly in an iterative fashion. 

We start at $k=0$ by initializing all state-value function (a vector) to $v_0(s)=0$. In each iteration $k$ we start with the state value function of the previous iteration $v_k(s)$ and apply the Bellman expectation backup as prescribed by the one step lookahead tree below that is decorated relative to what we have seen in the Bellman expectation backup with the iteration information. This is called the synchronous backup formulation as we are updating all the elements of the value function vector at the same time.

*Tree representation of the state-value function with one step look ahead across iterations.*

The Bellman expectation backup is given by,

$$v_{k+1}(s) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal A} \pi(a|s) \left( \mathcal R_s^a + \gamma \sum_{s^\prime \in \mathcal S} \mathcal{P}^a_{ss^\prime} v_k(s^\prime) \right)$$

and in vector form,

$$\mathbf{v}^{k+1} = \mathbf{\mathcal R}^\pi + \gamma \mathbf{\mathcal P}^\pi \mathbf{v}^k$$

The [following source code](https://becomesentient.com/mdp-dynamic-programming/) is instructive and standalone. It executes the policy evaluation for the Gridworld environment from the many that are part of the Gym RL python library.
